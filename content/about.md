## About Me

I'm a computer science freshman at PES University, Bangalore.
I love exploring and building projects. Take a look at what I've [built](projects.html) (or my [Github](https://github.com/anirudhsudhir)).

## What I'm working on right now

- Building a [static site generator](https://github.com/acmpesuecc/ssg) written in Go.
- Learning the Rust programming language.
