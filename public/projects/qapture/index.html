However, the individual bytes remain in memory until they are overwritten by the OS.\nThis implies that if all of the individual bytes are read from memory and pieced together in the right order and format, the file could be recovered in certain cases.\nWhat’s a forensic image? A forensic image is a bit-by-bit copy of a physical storage device. It is primarily used in digital forensics to obtain data relevant to an investigation.\nThere are several types of forensic images. Qapture uses the RAW image format since it contains unmodified source data. The metadata associated with the disk or the files are stored in separate files, simplifying recovery.\nJPEG markers: A JPEG file is divided into segments, each starting with a marker. Markers are two bytes long and start with 0xFF. Some markers define segments that contain specific information about the image, such as the image dimensions, color space information, and more.\nOf these, the SOI(Start of image), (Application specific codes) and EOI(End of image) markers are the ones that denote the start and end of the JPEG file.\nThese markers are represented by various hexadecimal codes:\nSOI - 0xFF(255), 0xD8(216) APPn - 0xFF(255), 0xEn(224 to 239) (where n represents any hexadecimal digit) EOI - 0xFF(255), 0xD9(217) Block Sizes: Data is usually stored in blocks in a physical device. This means that for every file, a certain block is allocated. If the file size exceeds the block, it can utilize the following block. Even if a particular block is not completely used, the next file is stored in the following block, with the remaining free space in the current block called slack space. Different filesystems use different blocksizes. For example, the FAT filesystem usually utilizes 512 bytes per block.\nThis is important as a file read can be done in multiples of the block size, which drastically increases the speed of this operation.\nHow qapture works: Qapture is a CLI tool. The user runs it by passing the RAW image as an argument.\n./qapture IMAGE.raw Qapture checks if the file is valid and prompts the user for the block size of the RAW image. If a valid argument is provided, qapture reads X bytes of the image, where X corresponds to the block size, and stores it in an array.\nIt searches the block for a new image by checking if :\nthe first two bytes are 255(0xFF) and 216(0xD8) (indicating SOI) the third byte is 255 (0xFF) and the fourth is between 224 and 240 (0xEn) (indicating APPn) If these conditions are satisfied, it writes the array to a new JPEG in the binary format.\nWhile writing the array to the JPEG, qapture checks if the current and the following byte is 255(0xFF) and 217(0xD9) respectively (indicating EOI).\nIf an EOI is encountered, the EOI marker is written and file is closed. Qapture then reads the next X bytes from the RAW image.\nIf no EOI is encountered, qapture writes the entire array to the JPEG and reads the next X bytes.\nIf SOI and APPn markers are found, the existing file is closed, a new file is created and the process continues.\nIf the markers are not present, the array is written to the same file until an EOI is encountered or the block has been completely read and the cycle repeats.\nThis process continues until all of the RAW image is read.\nThe recovered images are stored in an ‘images’ directory created by the application within the project directory.\nLimitations and future scope: Qapture is an advanced version of an application built as part of a course I was taking. As per the project specifications, qapture is designed to recover images without any associated metadata or information such as the Huffman table segments.\n",
