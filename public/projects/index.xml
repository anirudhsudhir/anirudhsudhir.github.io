      <description>qapture is a CLI tool to recover deleted JPEGs from a forensic image.
Background: When a file is deleted, it is removed from the file tree structure. However, the individual bytes remain in memory until they are overwritten by the OS.
This implies that if all of the individual bytes are read from memory and pieced together in the right order and format, the file could be recovered in certain cases.</description>
