Hello!

This is the first post that I'm writing for my personal site.
It's a proud moment to see my very own home on the internet, powered by a handcrafted static site generator.

While I began writing this post today, the site in itself has been a long time coming.

### Background

I already had a website running before, written in markdown and rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). While this was convenient and worked well, it wasn't really satisfying. I wanted to build a custom static site generator to render my site.
As part of [AIEP](https://acmpesuecc.github.io/aiep), our team, consisting of Adhesh, Aditya, Nathan and me, began building [one](/posts/building-ssg.html) in Go. I also managed to snag a lovely domain.

Fast forward a few weeks and I've got the site up and running. Staying up late has been worth it.

### What plans do I have for this site?

Honestly, I'm not sure. My vision is to use this as a space where I document my goals, achievements and all the things I've learned along the way. It should inspire me and provide a window to share my insights with others.

I do not intend to achieve perfection with every post. It quickly leads to burnout. Rather, this would be an ever-evolving collection that grows over time.

I also plan to write often. With college making life hectic, shorter, frequent posts seem like a good idea.

Hopefully, this is start of something amazing.
